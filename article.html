<p style="text-align:center"; style="font-size:20px"; style="font-family:RockwellExtraBold"; "margin-left:10%"; "margin-right:10%">The idea of exploring the jazz music genre came out from our common passion for music in all its forms. In particular, we started to better appreciate this beautiful genre since we moved to Bologna, participating in jazz nights or events. This was the main reason for us to choose this specific theme. Once we identified the topic to focus on, we googled some more information about how the city manages to improve the jazz genre. 
Based on web search results, jazz music in Bologna has a long and rich history, with many venues, festivals and associations dedicated to promoting and spreading the jazz culture. The Bologna Jazz Festival and Camera Jazz and Music Club are examples of jazz promotion.
Some of the main musicians born in this city who contributed to the development of jazz music are Paolo Fresu, a trumpet and flugelhorn player, composer and arranger who has collaborated with many international artists and won several awards, and Luca Carboni, a singer-songwriter who started his career in the 1980s and mixed pop, rock and jazz influences in his songs. However, also the songwriter and actor Cesare Cremonini contributed in developing the genre as the leader of the pop-rock band LÃ¹napop and then pursued a successful solo career, incorporating elements of jazz, soul and funk in his music. 
These are some examples of the many talented jazz musicians born in Bologna who have enriched the jazz scene with their creativity and originality.
Bologna has a vibrant jazz scene with several clubs and festivals that promote and spread jazz culture, such as Jazz Club Bologna, Bologna Jazz Festival and Cantina Bentivoglio.
